PHENOMENA - blue Program Scripts

The file phenomena.script contains a folder of blue program scripts that were used while composing Phenomena.  They are not required for opening and running Phenomena, but were used at composition time to aid in analyzing the material used as well as in renaming of SoundObjects from their contents. To use these scripts, go to the Scripts menu and choose "Manage Script Library", then right-click on the root folder node and choose "Import".  After choosing the script file and confirming, a folder of scripts labeled "Phenomena" will be available.  

NOTE: These scripts are customized for the piece and are not likely to work outside of Phenomena without editing.
