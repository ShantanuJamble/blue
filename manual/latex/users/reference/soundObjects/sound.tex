\subsection{Sound SoundObject}\label{sound}

Accepts NoteProcessors: no

Inline instruments. When experimenting with sounds, or if you're going
to make a soundEffect and not a whole composition, it might be tedious
to go and make an instrument and then have to edit score information.
This object is here so that you can add instruments directly to the
timeline. What is generated is a minimal i-statement that corresponds to
the sound soundObject's bar on a timeline. This abstracts a concept of
working with the sound itself instead of through the level of time of a
note.
