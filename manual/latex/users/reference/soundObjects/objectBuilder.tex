\subsection{ObjectBuilder}\label{objectBuilder}

Accepts NoteProcessors: Yes

This SoundObject allows users to build their own SoundObjects by using
the same widgets and features as the
\protect\hyperlink{blueSynthBuilder}{BlueSynthBuilder} for creating user
interfaces, as well as using either Python script or External Script for
the score generation. When generating score, the script has token values
replaced by values from the user interface before generating. The
scripts generated in the same manner as the
\protect\hyperlink{pythonObject}{PythonObject} and as the
\protect\hyperlink{externalSoundObject}{ExternalObject} .

Note: The code completion feature using ctrl-shift-space for values from
the UI that is available in BlueSynthBuilder is also available in this
SoundObject.
