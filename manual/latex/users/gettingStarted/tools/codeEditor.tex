Blue uses the Netbeans Code Editor library for editing code. The editor
is customized depending on where you are in the application, but there
are common features shared. Some things which are available are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Syntax Highlighting
\item
  Code Completion (ctrl-space)
\item
  Line Numbering (enabled globally in program settings)
\item
  Popup Menu (use right-mouse click) with additional options
\end{itemize}

You can adjust colors, fonts, and other settings within Blue's Program
Options.
