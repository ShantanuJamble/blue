\section{User-Defined Tools}\label{userDefinedTools}

Users may add their own tools which they may wish to call quickly from
blue (i.e. a favorite soundFile editting program). Under 'Tools', select
'Manage Tools' to add, edit, delete, or reorder your tools. Allowable
input here is 'tool name' which will be used by blue for displaying on
the tools menu, and 'command line' which blue will use to run the
program.
