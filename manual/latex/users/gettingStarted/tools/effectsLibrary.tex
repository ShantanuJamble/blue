\section{Effects Library}\label{effectsLibrary}

The Effects Library organizes Effects used with blue's mixer. You can
create and edit Effects, as well as organize Effects into Groups. The
layout of the tree that contains the effects will be used when building
the popup menu in the Mixer for selecting effects.
