<para>
	NoteProcessors are a powerful tool for manipulating notes.  Each type of 
	NoteProcessor serves a different purpose to adjust values for pfields.
	They can be used to apply musical effects to a group of notes; some 
	possible uses include humanizing rhythm, added crescendo/decrescendo, 
	reassigning notes to different instruments, applying time curves, 
	and transposition of material.

<para>
	NoteProcessors can be applied on a per-SoundObject basis. They can also
	be applied to an entire SoundLayer to affect all SoundObjects on that layer, 
	as well as applied globally to all notes generated in a piece by applying
	the NoteProcessor to the root PolyObject.
