<title>Random Add Processor</title>

<para>Parameters: pfield, min, max</para>

<para>The RandomAddProcessor takes a pfield to apply the random add to, as well as a
min and max for the boundaries of the random values.  When applied, it will add a random
value to each note in the assigned pfield, using a new random value per note. </para>

<para>The RandomAddProcessor expects either a positive or negative float value for
the min an max, and a postive integer for the pfield. The following score:</para>

<programlisting>
i1 0 2 80
i1 + . 80
i1 + . 80
i1 + . 80
</programlisting>

<para>If processed with an RandomAddProcessor with min set to 0.0, max set to 
1.0, and pfield set to 4, resulted in the following on one pass:</para>

<programlisting>
i1	0.0	0.5	80.92294
i1	0.5	0.5	80.50539
i1	1.0	0.5	80.112495
i1	1.5	0.5	80.93934
</programlisting>

<para>(The p2 and p3 times above are post-processing for a 2 second duration
soundObject with time behavior or scale.)</para> 

<para>If the score was generated again it would undoubtedly have slightly 
different values in the generated score's p4 fields as the values are generated
randomly in the range given between min and max.</para>

<para>Hint: One useful way to use this noteProcessor is as a way to "humanize"
velocity or pitch values values.</para>
