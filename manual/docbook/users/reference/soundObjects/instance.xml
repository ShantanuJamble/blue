<title>Instance</title>
         
<para>Accepts NoteProcessors: yes</para>
         
<para>A soundObject pointing to a soundObject in the soundObject library. The
content of the soundObject is not editable except by editing the soundObject in
the library to which the instance is pointing to. If editing the soundObject in
the library, all instances that point to that soundObject will be changed.
</para>

<para>
When clicking on an Instance object to edit it, the soundObject from the library
will show its editor instead in the soundObject edit area but it will be clearly
marked that the user is currently editing a library soundObject and not an
individual soundObject.

<para>The instance object is very useful if your work entails using many
variations of single source of material; you could take a soundObject, put it
into the library, then make 10 instances of it, adding noteProcessors to
'transpose' it, or get the 'retrograde of it', etc. and then perhaps later, if
you decided you wanted to change the initial material, you'd only have to edit
it once within the library, maintaining all of the transformations and
relationships that were add via noteProcessors. You could also later change your
mind and decide that you want to not have an instance there, so you could
convert it to a generic score (a rt-click on the instance object and a menu
click a way) and then be able to work with the source material again.</para>
