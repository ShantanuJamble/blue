<title>GenericScore </title>
         
<para>Accepts NoteProcessors: yes</para>
         
<para>Contains a block of csound score. The objective time
  within the genericScore starts at time 0, and notes within the genericScore
  are written relative to that. Moving the genericScore around translates
  the starting time of the notes within in it, and stretching the block
 scales the subjective time of the score.  </para>

<title>Try This</title>

<para>Let's say you have a block of score starting at 0, i.e.:</para>
         
<para>i1 0 1 2 3 4 5</para>
         
<para>i1 1 1 2 3 4 5</para>
         
<para>i1 2 1 2 3 4 5</para>
         
<para>Make three copies of on the main timeline. now move
  them so they start at different times, and then resize them. Now generate
  a .csd file from selecting the "Generate CSD to screen" option from the
project menu. Take a look at the generated CSD file and compare it
to what is in blue.</para>
