    BlueShare is an online, in-program way to share instruments and effects
    with other blue users. BlueShare does not require a user account to download
    items, but does require one for uploading. If you would like to share an 
    instrument or effect, please sign up for an account at
    <ulink url="http://blue.kunstmusik.com">http://blue.kunstmusik.com</ulink>
  </para>
  
  <para>
    To use BlueShare, go to the Tools menu to open it up.  Blue will contact
    the server to get a list of Instrument and Effects available.  From there,
    you can browse categories, then select an item in the upper-right table to
    get more information. Once you find something you are interested to try,
    select "Import Instrument" or "Import Effect".  The instrument or effect
    will download to your User Instrument Library or Effects Library in a folder
    called "Imported Instruments" or "Imported Effects".

    instruments or effects from your libraries, a tree of categories to use
    for uploading, and a description box (pre-populated with the Comments field
    of your Instrument or Effect). You can then press the "Submit" button to
    send it to the server.
