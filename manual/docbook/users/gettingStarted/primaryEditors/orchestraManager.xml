<title>INTRODUCTION</title>

<para>The Orchestra Manager is where the user organizes and edits the orchestra
for the project as well as their user Instrument Library.</para>

<title>User Instrument Library</title>

<para>In the User Instrument Library (the tree pictured on the left), you can create
instruments as well as categorize them into groups. Most actions in this editor
are accessible by right clicking with the mouse to access popup menus. (keyboard
shortcuts of ctrl-x, ctrl-c, and ctrl-v work for cutting, copying, and pasting
nodes of the tree). To edit the name of Instruments or Groups, double click the
name in the tree or hilight the node and press F2. This library of instruments is
available across projects and is useful for building up and organizing a personal
instrument library.  To copy instruments into the library from the project's Orchestra,
you can drag and drop the instrument on the library tree to make a copy of the instrument.
To copy an instrument from the Library to the project's orchestra, select an instrument in
the library and use the "&gt;" arrow button.</para> </simplesect>

<title>Orchestra</title>

<para>The Orchestra panel (located in the top right of the picture) is where
you will organized your instruments to be used for your project. The three buttons
to the left of the Arrangment table will add a selected instrument(&quot;+&quot;),
add a selected instrument from the user's Instrument Library to the project's orchestra
(&quot;&gt;&quot;), or remove a selected instrument from the
Orchestra(&quot;-&quot;). Once instruments are in the Orchestra, you can
edit what their instrument ID's will be, be it a number in classical Csound
style or a string for using named-instruments. (i.e. 3 for "instr 3", violin for
"instr violin"). </para>

<simplesect>
<title>Instrument Editor</title>

<para>In the bottom right is where the instrument editor for the selected
instrument is shown.</para>

<para>Depending on the blue instrument-type, different editors will appear here
when selected in either the Orchestra table or Instrument Library tree.</para>
</simplesect>

<simplesect>
<title>Legacy Projects</title>

<para>For projects before 0.94.0, imported projects will have their instruments
largely setup in the same way as they were before.</para>

<para>For projects that were in the 0.94.0 beta series, per-project Instrument
Libraries will be removed.  An option to import the instrument library will
be presented to the user and if the user agrees, a folder entitled "Imported from
Project" will be added to the root of the user's InstrumentLibrary.  On the whole,
it is recommended to import the library, review the instruments, and simply remove
what is not necessary. Deleting the imported library is as simple as deleting the
folder for the imported group. Instruments in these project's Arrangements will
be modified to hold copies of the instruments from the library as opposed to
being references to instrument in the library.  (Previously, if two instruments
in the Arrangement pointed to the same instrument in the per-project
InstrumentLibrary, changes to the instrument in the library would affect all
instruments in the Arrangment that pointed to it. Now, only copies are made and
no references are used.)</para>
