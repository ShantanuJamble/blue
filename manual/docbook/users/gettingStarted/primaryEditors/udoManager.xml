	<para>
		This is where users should put their User-Defined Opcodes. UDO's
		are added by using the "+" button and removed by using the "-"
		button to the left the table on top.
	</para>

	<para>
		To shift the order of the opcodes up and down, select an opcode in the
		table and use the "^" and "V" buttons to push up and push down.
	</para>

	<para>
		To edit the UDO, select one from the table above. After
		selecting a UDO, it's information will be shown in the editor
		area below.
	</para>

	<para>
		You may also cut, copy, and paste UDO's by right-clicking an
		entry in the top table. UDO's in the copy buffer can be pasted
		into other project files.

		<para>
			For UDO's, you will need the name of the UDO, the intypes
			and outtypes, and the body of the code itself. For the body
			of the code, you will not need anything from the "opcode"
			line that normally starts a UDO definition (i.e. "opcode
			myOpcode, a, ak"), as those should be in the text fields for
			Opcode Name, In Types, and Out Types, and you will not need
			an "endop", as blue will add that itself.

			Using the "I" Button will open up the UDO Repository
			browser. The browser shows the available UDO's in the
			repository on Csounds.com and allows for importing from the
			repository straight into your project.
