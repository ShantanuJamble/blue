by using:</para>

</screen>

<screen>
blue -j somePythonScript.py
</screen>

<para>This will interpet a python file using blue (having access to all of
blue's class libraries) you can use (this doesn't quite work on windows, a bug
in jython21).</para>

blue -u c:\myBlueConfigDir
</screen>

<para>This will allow you to use a different user configuration directory 
instead of the default (userHome)/.blue.</para>
